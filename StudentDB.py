#   Student Database Management with MongoDB  -|
#   -------------------------------------------|


#   Introduction  -|
#   ---------------|
#   This assignment on Student Database Management using MongoDB focuses on applying database design principles
#   and query operations to manage student information efficiently.
#   The project workflow includes:
#    - Database Setup: Creating a MongoDB database named StudentDB and a collection called students.
#    - Data Insertion: Populating the collection with at least 15 diverse student records, including fields such as Roll, 
#                      Name, Course, Marks, City, and EmailID.
#    - Query Operations: Retrieving student data using basic queries, such as finding students by course, marks threshold, 
#                        or city.
#    - Update and Delete: Modifying specific student records by updating email and marks, and removing records with low marks.
#    - Aggregation and Reporting: Generating statistics such as count and average marks per course, identifying top performers, 
#                                and sorting records for better insights.
#    - Data Export: Saving the student dataset in JSON format for external use.
#   The goal is to demonstrate how MongoDB can be effectively used for CRUD operations and data analysis in managing student
#   information within an academic setting.

#   Conclusion  -|
#   -------------|
#   The assignment successfully implemented a complete database management pipeline using MongoDB for student data,
#   covering data insertion, querying, updating, deletion, aggregation, and export functionalities.
#   Key Findings:
#    - The database handled diverse student records, supporting efficient storage and retrieval through flexible queries.
#    - Aggregation pipelines provided valuable insights, such as counting students per course and calculating average marks.
#    - Updates and deletions ensured data integrity by reflecting changes like email correction and removing underperforming
#      students.
#    - Sorting and top-performer queries helped highlight high-achieving students across various courses.
#    - Exporting data into JSON format allowed seamless sharing and integration with other systems.
#   Overall, the project demonstrated how MongoDBâ€™s document-oriented structure and aggregation framework can be leveraged
#   to manage, analyze, and report on structured datasets effectively, making it a powerful tool for academic and real-world
#   applications.
